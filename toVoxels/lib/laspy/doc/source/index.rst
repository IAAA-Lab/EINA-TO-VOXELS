Laspy: Documentation
=================================

.. note::

    The laspy documentation is currently having trouble with readthedocs, and the latest online version is therefore incomplete. Documentation for the release version 1.2.5 is available at `python hosted`_, and the latest documentation can be built from the source at github. 

Laspy is a python library for reading, modifying, and creating .LAS LIDAR files. It is available
at https://github.com/grantbrown/laspy
Laspy was designed for python 2.7.
